## Overview

### The challenge

Collaborate with fellow developers to build a front-end application that is interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input) and utilizes at least two server-side APIs. The application will be live and deployed to Github pages.

### User Story

    AS A gamer 
    I WANT to play a pokemon battle game with a friend
    SO THAT I can have some fun

### Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN I am playing a two player game
    WHEN I click the ‘generate decks’ button
    THEN two random card hands are displayed
    WHEN I click on a player’s dice roll button
    THEN I am presented with a random pokemon from player’s hand with its corresponding stats 
    WHEN I press the "battle button" 
    THEN the two pokemon battle each other based on their HP and attack stats.
    WHEN the pokemon battle
    THEN the pokemon shake to visualize a hit
    WHEN a pokemon faints for a player
    THEN then the card styling changes
    WHEN a player’s hand reaches 0
    THEN the winning player is highlighted and a form for  player name is displayed

### What was learned
The team was able to work colloboratively in an AGILE scrum setting and work towards the goal in a sprint (2-week) timeline. Front-end and back-end skills were used to develop dynamic features on the page; such as storing local data, card animations, and event listeners. 
We were able to successfully incorporate two server-side APIs to build a two-player game.
